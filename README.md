GRKArrayDiff
=======
Given two NSArrays, a previous and a current, GRKArrayDiff will report all deletions,
insertions, moves, and modifications. This is specifically targeted for array backed data
models which are used to support Table Views and Collection Views, but is generally
applicable as well.

# **NOTE:** This repository has been removed from the public due to circumstances out of my control.

Lastly, if you find yourself here, reading the above, and the removal of this open source repository has impacted you I would appreciate [hearing from you](mailto:levigroker@gmail.com) in the hopes I can use your feedback and a means to re-instate my ability to provide this framework and CocoaPod to the community.
